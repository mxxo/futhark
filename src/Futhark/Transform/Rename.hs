-- | This module provides facilities for transforming Futhark programs such
-- that names are unique, via the 'renameProg' function.
-- Additionally, the module also supports adding integral \"tags\" to
-- names (incarnated as the 'ID' type), in order to support more
-- efficient comparisons and renamings.  This is done by 'tagProg'.
-- The intent is that you call 'tagProg' once at some early stage,
-- then use 'renameProg' from then on.  Functions are also provided
-- for removing the tags again from expressions, patterns and typs.
